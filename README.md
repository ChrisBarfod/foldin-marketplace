## Problem

Quality, artisan, origami paper is hard to efficiently acquire online. Many websites are unattractive, convoluted, hard to navigate and have limited functionality. 
Many physical art stores only offer a rudimentary selection of paper types which won’t meet the needs of someone who’d like to purchase higher quality paper or buy in bulk. Online access to these options will allow these people to develop their craft.

## Solution

Construct a simple, streamlined, functional website where users can buy and sell origami paper, instruction books and their paper craft creations.

## Design Decisions

The fonts and color selection I chose are inviting and easy to read. The main header font (Iceland) is indicative of folded paper, thus applicable to the site.

## Future development / project improvements

There are many 'sprinkles' I'd like to implement in the website. User profile views and inter user messaging are the primary ones.


## Code review 
- Received code review from Katie for Sendgrid functionality to ameliorate problem due to out of date documentation for its integration with rails 5.
- Gave review to Jen to fix problems with Carrierwave. Also provided helpful shortcuts to increase efficiency.
